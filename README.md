Installation is a matter of getting the `Yellowhammer.tmTheme` file from this repository and placing it into your `Packages` directory. You can find this directory in Sublime Text 3 by choosing `Preferences > Browse Packages...` from the top menu. To get the theme, you can choose any of the following options:

#### Using git

While inside the `Packages` directory, clone the repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/mvune/yellowhammer.git
```

#### Manually

* Download the repository [.zip](https://github.com/mvune/yellowhammer/archive/master.zip)
* Unzip the files
* Copy the unzipped folder (or just the `Yellowhammer.tmTheme` file) to the `Packages` directory

## Activate

After installation, to activate the theme, either go to `Preferences > Settings` and update the `"color_scheme"` setting to the following:
```
{
    "color_scheme": "Packages/Yellowhammer.tmTheme"
}

```
...or simply go to `Preferences > Color Scheme` and choose `Yellowhammer`.
